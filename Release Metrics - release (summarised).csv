While this represents solid delivery output, the volume of new issues—particularly the 110 Zendesk tickets opened versus 54 resolved—signals heightened post-release customer impact that requires continued focus.
Content, Curation, and Opportunities (CCO) emerged as a positive area, both solving the most bugs (5) and maintaining active development momentum. The team addressed critical issues around file processing, content updates via API, and pathway management, demonstrating consistent progress in core functionality areas. Academy-related fixes also showed positive momentum with 4 resolved issues addressing project submissions, progress tracking, and admin permissions—critical areas for user experience.
Skills and Academies functionality generated elevated concern, with Skills-related bugs increasing substantially (5 new issues including Skills+ publishing problems and skill standard assignment failures) and Academies experiencing critical duplication and syncing issues. The concentration of Academy bugs around duplicate functionality and completion tracking suggests systemic architectural challenges requiring deeper investigation.
SLA performance remains critically challenged with all P2 Major bugs exceeding their 30-day target and only 69% of P3/P4 bugs meeting the 120-day SLA. One particularly concerning P3 bug (PD-102497) remained open for 422 days before resolution, highlighting ongoing technical debt that continues to impact delivery timelines and customer satisfaction.","CCO:9, Skills:5, Platform Experience:4, Academies:4, Content Marketplace:3, Learner Experience:3, Reporting:3, Mobile (Android & iOS):2, External API:2, DevOps:1, Integrations:1, Other:2",7,"Integrations:2, CCO:1, Platform Experience:1, Platform UI & Tooling:1, Skills:1"

We opened 32 new bugs while solving only 23 (21 + 2 ACM), resulting in 9 net new bugs added to the backlog. The ratio of bugs opened to solved indicates the release introduced new issues or surfaced existing problems at a rate faster than the team's resolution capacity.
Mobile platform issues are gaining attention. Multiple bugs were reported around the Android/iOS mobile app experience, including video playback failures in pathways, display language inconsistencies showing French (Canada) instead of French, and connection errors with Maestro options. This concentration of mobile bugs suggests the mobile experience requires focused stabilization work.
Strong resolution of automation and reporting issues. The team successfully addressed several critical automation bugs affecting user group assignments, assigned learning displays, and trigger configurations. Reporting fixes included resolving dynamic admin group permissions and pathway follower report errors, improving administrative functionality for (tech) admin users.
Academy platform showing healthy progress but limited scope. Only 2 Academy bugs were resolved in the specified timeframe, addressing critical search visibility and video rendering issues. However, new academy-related bugs continue to emerge around session timeouts, automation emails, bulk nudge functionality, and help widget display, suggesting ongoing platform maturation challenges.
Skills+ feature continues maturation process. Multiple bugs both opened and closed relate to Skills+ functionality, including skill scale changes, suggestion workflows, bulk approval processes, and modal displays. The ongoing attention to this newer feature area is expected as it stabilizes with real-world usage patterns.","Skills:4, Platform Experience:4, Mobile (Android & iOS):3, CCO:3, Integrations:3, Academies:3, Learner Experience:3, Reporting:3, Content Marketplace:2, Data Science:1, Other:3",3,"Integrations:1, Learner Experience:1, Reporting:1"

This  ratio of bugs opened to closed is a concerning trend that suggests the release may have introduced new issues or exposed existing problems that require immediate attention to prevent further backlog accumulation.
Content Marketplace team contribution: The ACM Content Marketplace team resolved 5 critical bugs during the two-week cycle, including academy member upload issues, project submission problems, completion syncing issues, and session timeout errors. These fixes addressed high-impact issues affecting multiple enterprise accounts and accounted for 18 Zendesk tickets, demonstrating strong focus on customer-reported problems.
Skills and integration challenges persist: Multiple bugs were logged related to Skills features (skill profiles, ratings, assignments) and various integrations (SuccessFactors, Pluralsight, CSV collectors). The opened bugs span across Discovery pages, API issues, file upload problems, and Skills management, indicating that recent feature development or platform changes may have introduced regressions that need systematic investigation.
SLA performance requires attention: Only 12 of 17 bugs (71%) were resolved within SLA targets. One P2 Major bug exceeded its 30-day SLA by 25 days (taking 55 days total), and four P3 Minor bugs significantly exceeded the 120-day threshold (ranging from 137-201 days). These older bugs represent technical debt from March through May that should be prioritized to maintain service commitments and customer trust.","Learner Experience:7, Content Marketplace:7, CCO:6, Platform Experience:5, Skills:4, External API:3, DS/AI:2, Reporting:1, Platform UI & Tooling:1, Manager Experience:1, Other:2",5,"Content Marketplace:1, CCO:1, Learner Experience:1, Platform Services:1"

With 41 bugs reported versus only 24 resolved (21 LXP + 3 ACM), we're seeing a net increase of 17 bugs in the backlog. This ratio of opened-to-solved indicates the release may have introduced instability or that client-reporting velocity has increased substantially.
Integration and catalog-related issues dominated both opened and solved bugs this cycle. Notably, multiple third-party integrations experienced failures (Workday, GetAbstract, Coursera, Docebo, GenericCSV/RSS), suggesting potential systemic issues with the integration framework or recent changes affecting collector reliability. Reporting and Skills functionality issues remain persistent themes, with multiple bugs related to data display, skill ratings, and report accuracy. This pattern has appeared in previous cycles.
Positive note: SLA compliance at 67% shows the team is resolving most bugs within reasonable timeframes, with P3 Minor bugs performing particularly well at 86% compliance (12 of 14). The quick resolution times for bugs within SLA (6-14 days for P2, 0-75 days for P3) demonstrate strong execution when issues are prioritized.
Critical concern: P2 Major bug SLA compliance is only 40% (4 of 10), with critical issues taking 38-101 days to resolve when they exceed SLA. This suggests either improper priority assignment or resource constraints preventing timely resolution of high-priority client-impacting issues.","Learner Experience:8, CCO:7, Integrations:6, Skills:5, Platform Experience:5, Content Marketplace:4, Reporting:4, DevOps:1, Mobile (Android & iOS):1",8,"Integrations:4, DS/AI:2, Learner Experience:1, Reporting:1"

With 68 bugs opened versus only 26 resolved (24 LXP + 2 ACM), this release produced a net increase of +42 bugs. This dramatic spike suggests the November 11th deployment introduced substantial new defects across multiple system areas.
Localization failures dominated new issues, with 9 bugs affecting internationalization including broken Spanish translations, null language codes in xAPI statements, and incorrect decimal separators in French/French Canadian. Skills+ translation problems were particularly prevalent, impacting pathway displays and skill filter functionality across non-English interfaces.
Post-deployment production incidents required immediate attention, notably ElasticSearch errors affecting search platform-wide, missing Learner Home Insight Cards impacting multiple clients, authentication failures at login, and a critical API server startup blocker. These high-severity issues suggest insufficient pre-release testing of core functionality.
Long-standing technical debt was addressed, including a 582-day-old CredSpark GAT assessment bug (dating to March 2024), a 147-day search filter issue, and a 137-day authentication redirect problem.
